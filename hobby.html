          <h1><strong>Pleasant </strong>Music</h1>
          <p>Music is the only way to nutralize our body and mind. I used to hear music in my free time it helps me for relaxation Hearing music is a complex auditory experience that involves the processing of sound waves by the ear and the interpretation of those sounds by the brain. The quality of our hearing can greatly impact our ability to fully enjoy and appreciate music. The human ear can detect a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, which allows us to perceive the various components of music, such as melody, harmony, and rhythm. Our brains then process and interpret these components to create the emotional and aesthetic experience of hearing music.</p>

          <h2>Action <strong>Gaming</strong></h2>
          <p>Playing Games is good for problem solving and better for stress relief. I used to play Free Fire for relaxation but it's a limit.  Gaming can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, depending on factors such as the type of game, the amount of time spent playing, and the individual's personality and social context. On the positive side, gaming can enhance cognitive skills such as attention, memory, and problem-solving, as well as provide a sense of achievement and social connection. However, excessive gaming can lead to addiction, negative impacts on mental health, and reduced physical activity</p>
